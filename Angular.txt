AngularJS provides built-in support to communicate with a server. You can either use an XMLHttpRequest object (async request) or JSON (sync or async request).

$http is a core Angular service that provides access to low-level interactions with remote Http services using the XMLHttpRequest object. The $http API is used to perform asynchronous operations and returns a promise object to the caller which can be used to receive notifications about the Ajax request. We can make use of then() method of the promise object to register callbacks. Other methods defined by a promise object are success (callback) and fail(callback) to handle success and fail respectively for the callback. The success callback function receives the data retrieved from the server, and the error callback receives details of any errors.


Following is the list of method offered by $http
•$http.get
•$http.post
•$http.put
•$http.delete
•$http.patch



In the Scripts folder add a new JavaScript file of name Logic.js. Add the following code in it:


//The Module
var app = angular.module('md',[]);
 
//The service with the get method. 
app.service('ms', function ($http) {
    this.getData = function () {
        var resp = $http.get("http://localhost:15377/api/TestAPI");
        return resp;
    };     
});
 
//The Controller
 
app.controller('ctrl', function ($scope,ms) {
 
    loadData();
 
    function loadData() {
        //The controller call the function from the service
        var promiseGetData = ms.getData();
        //Callback with success and failure
        promiseGetData.then(function (res) {
            $scope.Persons = res.data;
            $scope.Message = "Call Completed Successfully...";
        }, function (err) {
            $scope.Message = "Call failed" + err.status + "  " + err.statusText;
        });
    }
    $scope.Person = {
        FirstName: "" ,
        LastName: ""
    };   
});

•First, you will learn the basics of AngularJS: directives, expressions, filters, modules and controllers. 
•Then you will learn everything else you need to be familiar with Angular. 
•Events, DOM, Forms, Input, Validation, HTTP.


1:Directives
2.Expressions
3.$scope object
4.Controllers
5.Model
6.Module
7.Filters
8.Data binding



1  :Directives
•ng-app
•ng-model
•ng-controllers
•ng-click
•ng-repeat
•ng-view
•ng-bind

2. Expressions 
•The {{   }} are a declarative way of specifying a data binding location in HTML. AngularJS will automatically update this text.


3.
Angular Module
An Angular module is simply a collection of functions defined in a JavaScript file. 


ng-model
ng-controller
ng-submit
ng-show
ng-model
ng-App
ng-class
$dirty
$scopr

Controllers
In Angular, a Controller is a JavaScript constructor function that augments the Angular Scope.

$scope object
•Scope is the glue between an application controller and the view.



6:Filters
Filters allow formatting the data to be displayed on the DOM. Filters are invoked in the HTML with the | (pipe) character inside expressions {{ }}.
