******************Angular  Interview Questions**************
Sharing Data across Angular.js Controllers:
Angular.js is commonly related to Single Page Applications (SPA). In SPA applications, we have several Views loaded in one master page (you can call it as an Index page) in which case, we have one or more controllers bound with one View. When we navigate from one view to another, we may want to pass data across views using one controller to another.
To pass or share data across controllers, we need to make use of the Angular Factory object.

********************Diff B/w service() or factory()*****************
The advantage of using factory is that, we can have typical coding style of declaring private and public functions like a class. So we can hide a specific functionality form direct access from the injectable components.
One major difference between Angular.js  Service and Factory is a Service is a constructor function, whereas a Factory is not. If we use service() or factory(), internally a factory always gets called which in turn creates a provider for our service.
Whether to use Factory or Service is purely a coding standard choice. A Factory is more preferred because of its class like definition whereas Service are used when we are using ES6 classes or when we plan to migrate to ES6.

*************************$http*************************

AngularJS provides built-in support to communicate with a server. You can either use an XMLHttpRequest object (async request) or JSON (sync or async request).

$http is a core Angular service that provides access to low-level interactions with remote Http services using the XMLHttpRequest object. The $http API is used to perform asynchronous operations and returns a promise object to the caller which can be used to receive notifications about the Ajax request.

•$http.post
•$http.put
•$http.delete
•$http.patch

//The Module
var app = angular.module('md',[]);
 
//The service with the get method. 
app.service('ms', function ($http) {
    this.getData = function () {
        var resp = $http.get("http://localhost:15377/api/TestAPI");
        return resp;
    };     
});
 
//The Controller
 
app.controller('ctrl', function ($scope,ms) {
 
    loadData();
 
    function loadData() {
        //The controller call the function from the service
        var promiseGetData = ms.getData();
        //Callback with success and failure
        promiseGetData.then(function (res) {
            $scope.Persons = res.data;
            $scope.Message = "Call Completed Successfully...";
        }, function (err) {
            $scope.Message = "Call failed" + err.status + "  " + err.statusText;
        });
    }
    $scope.Person = {
        FirstName: "" ,
        LastName: ""
    };   
});
